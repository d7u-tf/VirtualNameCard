#‚ùìWhy are we still using physical name card?

How many time have you actually save the number from the name card you receive? Probably not very much. How many time do you think your client or the business partner that you want to know or impress save your number?

Let‚Äôs face the reality, most of the people don‚Äôt read name card after the first hand shake. Organizing business contact is even troublesome. However, companies are still spending money and cutting trees to print them. It‚Äôs not cost effective, it‚Äôs not sustainable, and it‚Äôs not useful.

We exchange name card for people to remember us. When they have business, we want them to have our number in their pocket so we are just one call away. 

#üíºMake your own Virtual Name Card

Virtual Name Card is a great solution to all the problem above:

1. Save the trees!
2. Save money for title change, new employee onboard, and badge update. 
3. People can directly save your number when you give them, or even direct them to your other social media like LinkedIn or GitHub
4. You can never forget your name card 
5. Building the professional and technical image. (You value your personal branding, you follow the trend, and you love earth üåè)

Most importantly, it‚Äôs completely FREE! 

Sounds good to you? Let‚Äôs get started! 

# Concept and Architecture

Virtual Name Card is basically a website that designed to display all your related information and link in a glance. You want to include your name, your title, and most importantly, your contact information.

So here‚Äôs the diagram of the Virtual Name Card:

In the project we use GitHub to host our website because it‚Äôs free and easy. If you already have a website hosting on other platform, you don‚Äôt necessary need to upload to GitHub.

Depends on how you want your audience to access your Virtual Name Card, you can optionally purchase a NFC tag or a NFC card (which are very very cheap) and use it to enhance the experience of the Virtual Name Card.
